# computer_vision
A repository to store my work on computer vision.
Whilst preparing for PiWars2018 I came across a program for a line follower using a Raspberry Pi Camera.
This insight into 'Computer Vision' really excited me as it was an area that I had never looked into before.
I am now working on Maze Navigation and this repository will contain this and other pieces of code relating to my study.
