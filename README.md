# Computer Vision
This is a repository to store my current work on computer vision.
For PiWars2018 our team invested in a PiBorg MonsterBorg the chassis used in Forumla Pi. During the development of the code and mechanics for the varios PiWars challenges I came across a program by PiBorg to follow a line using a Raspberry Pi Camera. The program used OpenCV to enable computer vision and this insight into a different level of robotics really excited me, as it was an area that I had never looked into before.
I am currently working on the 'Maze Navigation' but this repository will contain all of my pieces of code relating to my study.
